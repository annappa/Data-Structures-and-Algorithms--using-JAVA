## Notes
- There are several sorting algos. Refere wiki

- Careful about the built in sorting functions. we should be aware of the internal implementation of the sorting.

## SORTING ALGORITHM IN JAVA
Previously java used QuickSort for primitives and MergeSort for Objects. In the latest versions', java uses 'Dual-Pivot Quicksort' & 'TimSort'.
TIMSORT is a hybrid algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. to learn more about TimSort & Dual-pivot quicksort check
