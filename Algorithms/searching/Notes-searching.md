## Exercise
####If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

####If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, 
BFS (DFS will take long time. )

####If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

####If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
DFS

####determining whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS

####Finding the shortest path
BFS
